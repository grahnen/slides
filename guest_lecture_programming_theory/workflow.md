# Workflow
- You state a theorem you want to prove
- You write the proof in the style the prover accepts
- The prover checks correctness and progress at each step,
  - letting you know what remains to be proven

- _Warning!_
  - Time consuming
  - Addictive
  - Undermines your trust in informal proofs
