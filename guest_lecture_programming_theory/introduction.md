# Motivation
- Complex systems almost inevitably contain bugs
- Debugging suffers from diminishing returns: many critical bugs are never fixed
- Critical systems (avionics, ...) are required to meet a standard of $10^{-9}$ failures per hour. Testing is not sufficient!
- _Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!_ - Edsger W. Dijkstra
